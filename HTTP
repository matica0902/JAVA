A basic Web browsing session works as follows:

1.the user specifies a URL in their browser (either from a bookmark or by typing)
2.the browser initiates a TCP connection to the Web server (or server pool) via its IP address as published in DNS.
  (Web servers by default use TCP port 80 to service incoming requests.).
3.As part of this process, the browser also makes DNS lookup requests to convert the URL to an IP address
  after the server completes acknowledgement of its side of the TCP connection, the browser sends HTTP requests to 
  the server to retrieve content for the URL.
4.after the server replies with content for the Web page,the browser retrieves the content from the HTTP packets 
  and display it accordingly.
5.Content can include embedded URLs for advertising banners or other third-party content,that in turn triggers the
  browser to issue new TCP connection requests to those locations.
6.The browser may also save temporary information
  about its connections to local files on the client computer called cookies.
